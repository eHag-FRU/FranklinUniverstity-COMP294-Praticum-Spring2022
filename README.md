# FranklinUniversity-COMP294-Praticum-Spring2022

***
**Note:**

This is the project I partook in durring the first computer science praticum course (COMP-294: Computer Science Praticum I) at Franklin Universtiy. The level of work expected was to be a quality assurance person and test the application.

Instead I was given the role of a junior developer. I worked on several tickets, the first of which was the frontend of the login screen. The second ticket I was assigned was where most of the eight week development time I had was spent on. This was called the comic collections screen due to displaying the user's comic collection in a grid. On the right side of the homepage there is a scrollable list of the user's friends' activity.

The last ticket I worked on was testing the appplication, durring the last couple weeks of the project development time. I tried to test corner cases and made detailed documentation on how to replicate the issue, then sent it to the rest of the team.

## Comic Book Inventory System
In this project the team will build an inventorty system for ever growing comic book collections. Users will be able to create accounts, sign-in, and add view their whole collection. If they are interested in seeing the details of a particular issue they will be able to select and see those details. They will also be able to add issues to their collection every week when they come out.
